## Steps

### 1. Generate SSH Key on Jenkins Server

Run the following command on the Jenkins server to generate an SSH key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

### **2. Add Public Key to GitHub**

After generating the SSH key, add the public key (**`id_rsa.pub`**) to your GitHub account under SSH and GPG keys in the settings.

- Go to **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** and log in to your account.
- Click on your profile picture in the top right corner and navigate to **`Settings`**.
- Scroll down to the **`SSH and GPG keys`** section and click on **`New SSH key`**.
- Give your key a descriptive title, such as "Jenkins Server".
- Copy the contents of your **`id_rsa.pub`** file and paste it into the **`Key`** field.
- Click **`Add SSH Key`** to save the changes.

### **3. Modify SSH Config**

Create or modify the **`~/.ssh/config`** file to use the generated SSH key when connecting to GitHub. Add the following:

```bash
Host github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile /path/to/your/ssh/key
```

### **4. Test SSH Connection**

Test the SSH connection to GitHub using the following command:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

### **5. Create Credentials in Jenkins**

To create credentials in Jenkins, perform the following steps:

- Navigate to Jenkins and log in.
- Go to **`Manage Jenkins`** > **`Manage Credentials`**.
- Under **`(global)`**, click **`(Add)`**.
- Click on **`Jenkins`**.
- In the kind field, choose **`SSH Username with private key`**.
- Enter the **`ID`**, **`Description`**, and **`Username`** (usually **`git`** for GitHub).
- For the **`Private Key`**, choose **`Enter directly`** and paste the contents of your private key (**`id_rsa`**) file.
- Click **`OK`** to save the credentials.

### **6. Configure Jenkins**

In Jenkins, configure the project's source code management to use SSH when pulling from GitHub.
